## Alzheimer's Disease Risk Prediction

This project aims to predict the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease using machine learning models on demographic and lifestyle data. The goal is to provide a non-invasive, early risk assessment tool that can aid in preventive measures and timely intervention.

### Features

* Age, gender, family history, education level, physical activity, and medical history
* Preprocessed for handling missing values and normalization
* Feature selection to reduce noise and improve model performance

### Technologies Used

* **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**
* Machine Learning models: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, CatBoost
* Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

### Key Highlights

* Comparative analysis of multiple models to select the most effective one
* Data-driven insights into Alzheimer’s risk factors
* Lightweight and interpretable solution for healthcare data
